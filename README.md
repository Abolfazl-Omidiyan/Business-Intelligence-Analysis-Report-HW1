## 🔧 How to Run the Python Script

### Step 1: Prepare Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy

# Verify installations
python -c "import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy; print('✓ All packages installed')"
```

### Step 2: Place Data Files
Ensure these CSV files are in the same directory as the script:
- `top5000Query.csv`
- `top5000product.csv`

### Step 3: Run Analysis
```bash
python complete_bi_analysis.py
```

### Step 4: View Results
- Console output shows detailed analysis for each question
- Generated charts appear in current directory:
  - `q5_boxplot_histogram.png`
  - `q6_qqplot.png`
  - `q7_scatter.png`
  - `q9_violin_price.png`
  - `dashboard.png`

## 📊 Understanding the Data

### Query Dataset (top5000Query.csv)
- **5,000 rows** of search queries
- Columns: ID, RawQuery, Timestamp, Result, ClickedResult, ClickedRank
- Result/ClickedResult are Python-like list literals
- Must be parsed to extract product IDs

### Product Dataset (top5000product.csv)
- **4,999 rows** of products
- Columns: ID, CategoryName, Titles, MinPrice, MaxPrice, AvgPrice, MinNumShops, MaxNumShops, AvgNumShops
- **Special encoding:** Uses \x1b\x1b as row separator (not standard CSV)
- Requires custom parsing (handled by script)

### Data Limitation
Product IDs in queries (e.g., 7151290) exist in different namespace than product DB (e.g., 7, 8, 9). Only ~127 products match between datasets. In real scenario, full product catalog would be available.

## 📈 Key Insights from Analysis

### 🔴 Critical Findings
1. **Non-Normal Distribution:** Query frequency and retrieval counts are heavily right-skewed, NOT normally distributed
   - Implication: Use non-parametric statistical tests
   - Better fits: Power-law, Pareto, or Log-normal distributions

2. **Weak Correlations:** More retrievals don't guarantee more clicks
   - Product rank, title quality, and UX matter more
   - Category membership alone doesn't predict clicks

3. **Outliers Found:** 
   - 833 queries with extreme behavior (16.7%)
   - 654 products with extreme prices (15.3%)

### 🟢 Positive Findings
1. **Data Quality Generally Good:** No full duplicates, most values present
2. **Clear Patterns:** Zipf's Law evident (80/20 rule applies)
3. **Books High-Performing:** 92% CTR for Books category

### 💡 Business Recommendations
1. Focus on improving product relevance ranking, not just visibility
2. Optimize product titles, descriptions, and images (affect CTR)
3. Investigate high-retrieval/low-click products for UX issues
4. Implement featured placement for long-tail products
5. Use non-parametric statistical methods for analysis

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "FileNotFoundError: top5000Query.csv"
**Solution:** Place CSV files in the same directory as the script

### "No module named 'pandas'"
**Solution:** Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy --break-system-packages
```

### Charts not saving
**Solution:** Ensure script has write permissions in current directory

### Special characters in output
**Solution:** Already handled by script's encoding configuration

## 📚 References & Concepts

### Statistical Concepts Used
- **IQR (Interquartile Range):** Q3 - Q1, for outlier detection
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test:** Tests if data is normally distributed
- **Pearson Correlation:** Measures linear relationship strength
- **Chi-Square Test:** Tests independence of categorical variables
- **Zipf's Law:** Frequency ∝ 1/rank, common in natural phenomena

### Visualization Techniques
- **Boxplot:** Shows quartiles, median, whiskers, and outliers
- **Histogram:** Shows frequency distribution
- **QQ Plot:** Compares sample quantiles to theoretical quantiles
- **Scatter Plot:** Shows bivariate relationships
- **Violin Plot:** Combines boxplot with kernel density estimate
